# 🧠 **ETL Methodologies — Summary and Comparison**

🚧 *Work in Progress*  
This repository contains an ongoing theoretical study on **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **ELT** methodologies, developed for the **Information Systems II** course at the **Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra (ISEC)**.  
The final goal is to compare classical and modern approaches to **data integration** in the context of **Data Warehousing** and **Business Intelligence** systems.

---

## 📘 **Objectives**

- Understand the purpose and stages of ETL and ELT processes  
- Compare traditional and cloud-based data integration methodologies  
- Identify main tools and technologies used in modern data pipelines  
- Analyze advantages, limitations, and performance considerations of each approach  

---

## ⚙️ **Key Topics Covered**

- ETL and ELT concepts and workflows  
- Data staging and transformation layers  
- Data Warehouse architecture  
- Modern cloud ETL platforms (Azure Data Factory, AWS Glue, Google Dataflow)  
- Comparison between on-premises and cloud integration models  
- Best practices for scalability, automation, and data governance

## 💡 **Current Status**

The project is still under development.  
So far, the report includes:
- A conceptual overview of ETL vs. ELT  
- Preliminary comparison of tools and architectures  
- Notes on data transformation strategies and storage optimization  

Upcoming sections will expand the comparative analysis with performance, cost, and real-world use cases.
